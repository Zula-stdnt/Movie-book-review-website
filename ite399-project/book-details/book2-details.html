        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            A publishing event ten years in the making—a searing, exquisite new novel by the best-selling and award-winning author 
            of <i>Americanah</i> and <i>We Should All Be Feminists</i>—the story of four women and their loves, longings, and desires.
        </p>

            Chiamaka is a Nigerian travel writer living in America. Alone in the midst of the pandemic, she recalls her past lovers 
            and grapples with her choices and regrets. Zikora, her best friend, is a lawyer who has been successful at everything until — 
            betrayed and brokenhearted — she must turn to the person she thought she needed least. Omelogor, Chiamakas bold, outspoken 
            cousin, is a financial powerhouse in Nigeria who begins to question how well she knows herself. And Kadiatou, Chiamakas 
            housekeeper, is proudly raising her daughter in America - but faces an unthinkable hardship that threatens all she has worked 
            to achieve.

            In <i>Dream Count</i>, Adichie trains her fierce eye on these women in a sparkling, transcendent novel that takes up the very 
            nature of love itself. Is true happiness ever attainable or is it just a fleeting state? And how honest must we be with 
            ourselves in order to love, and to be loved? A trenchant reflection on the choices we make and those made for us, on daughters 
            and mothers, on our interconnected world, <i>Dream Count</i> pulses with emotional urgency and poignant, unflinching observations 
            on the human heart, in language that soars with beauty and power. It confirms Adichie's status as one of the most exciting 
            and dynamic writers on the literary landscape.
