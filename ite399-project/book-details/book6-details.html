        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            One woman, the performance of a lifetime. Or two. A mesmerizing Mobius strip of a novel that asks who we are to the people we love.
        </p>
        <p>
            Two people meet for lunch in a Manhattan restaurant. She's an elegant and accomplished actress in rehearsals for an upcoming premiere. 
            He's attractive, troubling, and young—young enough to be her son. Who is he to her, and who is she to him? In <i>Audition</i>, two competing 
            narratives unspool, rewriting our understanding of the roles we play every day—partner, parent, creator, muse—and the truths every 
            performance masks, especially from those who think they know us best.

        <h3>About the Structure</h3>
        <p>
            <i>Audition</i> employs a dual narrative structure that mirrors an actor's audition process - presenting competing versions 
            of the same relationship. The novel's taut prose has been compared to Rachel Cusk and Jenny Offill.

            <p><strong>LiteraryExplorer</strong> ★★★★☆</p>
            <p>"Kitamura's spare prose cuts deep. The age gap subtext elevates what could've been a simple character study."</p>
