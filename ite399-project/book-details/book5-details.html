        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            A surprising and beautiful meditation on the color blue—and its fascinating role in Black history and culture—from National Book Award winner Imani Perry.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout history, the concept of Blackness has been remarkably intertwined with another color: blue. In daily life, it is evoked in countless ways. 
            Blue skies and blue water offer hope for that which lies beyond the current conditions. But blue is also the color of deep melancholy and heartache, 
            echoing Louis Armstrong's question, “What did I do to be so Black and blue?” In this book, celebrated author Imani Perry uses the world's favorite 
            color as a springboard for a riveting emotional, cultural, and spiritual journey—an examination of race and Blackness that transcends politics or ideology.
        </p>
        <p>
            Perry traces both blue and Blackness from their earliest roots to their many embodiments of contemporary culture, drawing deeply from her own life 
            as well as art and history: The dyed indigo cloths of West Africa that were traded for human life in the 16th century. The mixture of awe and 
            aversion in the old-fashioned characterization of dark-skinned people as “Blue Black.” The fundamentally American art form of blues music, sitting 
            at the crossroads of pain and pleasure. The blue flowers Perry plants to honor a loved one gone too soon.
        </p>
        <p>
            Poignant, spellbinding, and utterly original, <i>Black in Blues</i> is a brilliant new work that could only have come from the mind of one of our 
            greatest writers and thinkers. Attuned to the harrowing and the sublime aspects of the human experience, it is every bit as vivid, rich, and striking 
            as blue itself.
